#######Flask App Deployment with HAProxy, Nginx Load Balancing, and SNMP Monitoring
This repository contains an Ansible playbook for deploying a Flask app behind HAProxy, with Nginx for UDP load balancing, SNMP monitoring on dev servers, and HAProxy performance UI. The deployment is based on the provided network architecture, where the hosts include HAproxy, devA, devB, devC, and Bastion.

Prerequisites
Before running the playbook, ensure that you have the following:

Ansible installed on your local machine.
Access to the hosts in the provided network architecture.
SSH keys configured for passwordless access between your local machine and the Bastion host, as well as between Bastion and other hosts.

Configuration
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Edit the config file to specify the IP addresses or hostnames of the Bastion host, HAProxy host, and devA, devB, devC servers.

Modify the group_vars/all.yml file to specify the necessary variables for your environment, such as usernames, paths, passwords, and other settings.

Running the Ansible Playbook
Open a terminal on your local machine.

Navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.

Run the following command to execute the Ansible playbook, providing the appropriate SSH key:

ansible-playbook -i hosts -F "path/to/Config_file" site.yaml

Verification
After the playbook has been executed successfully, the following components should be set up:

Flask app on devA, devB, and devC, responding to HTTP requests on port 80.
HAProxy load balancing incoming HTTP requests to devA, devB, and devC.
Nginx acting as a UDP load balancer for SNMP traffic on port 1611.
SNMP daemon installed and configured on devA, devB, and devC.
HAProxy performance UI available on port 8011 with password protection.
To verify the deployment, open a web browser and access the public IP address associated with HAProxy (HTTP/80). You should see responses from devA, devB, and devC.

Notes
The Flask app runs on port 80 for HTTP and port 1611 for UDP. Ensure that the Flask app code is properly configured for these ports.
Additional customizations and optimizations can be made based on your specific requirements.
For any issues or questions, please refer to the Ansible documentation and seek assistance from your system administrator.
Feel free to customize this README file further based on your specific environment and requirements. Make sure to provide clear instructions for prerequisites, configuration, and verification, and include any important notes for users.
